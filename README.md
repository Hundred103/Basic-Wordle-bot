# Simple Python Wordle Bot 

### Suggests words based on previous inputs

##### Input:

Enter a word to your wordle game, which is open in a separate tab.

Input the results into the cli like so:
 - if a letter is grey put no sign behind it
 - if a letter is yellow put a '+' behind it
 - if a letter is green put a '*' behind it

Input example:

```
ad*i*e+u
```

Which means 'a' and 'u' are grey, 'e' is yellow, 'd' and 'i' are green.

##### Limitations

Code is entirely deterministic. Just a simple string filter with arguments. More of a passion project than anythng really. Written in an hour, probably buggy ashel, sorry in advance :D.
